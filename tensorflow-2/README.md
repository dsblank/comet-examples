# Getting started with Comet
   * get an api key from https://www.comet.ml
   * install Comet:
```
    pip3 install comet_ml
    pip install comet_ml
```

## Set API Key as an environment variable
```
export COMET_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

## Running Distributed Training
The distributed training examples will require a multi-GPU machine and at least `tensorflow-gpu==2.4.0`

### MultiWorkerMirrored strategy example

The following commands will start the MultiWorkerMirrored strategy with two workers on `localhost:8001` and `localhost:8002`.

Start worker 1 on `localhost:8001` 
```
python comet-tensorflow-distributed-multiworker-mirrored-strategy.py --worker_hosts localhost:8001,localhost:8002 --task_index 0
```

In a separate terminal, Start worker 2 on `localhost:8002`
```
python comet-tensorflow-distributed-multiworker-mirrored-strategy.py --worker_hosts localhost:8001,localhost:8002 --task_index 1
```

### Parameter Server strategy example

When running the parameter server strategy example, we recommend allocating a single GPU to each process. This can be done by setting the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` envrionment variable to the appropriate GPU ID. For example, `export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0` will only allow the process to access GPU ID 0.

Once you have done this, the following commands will start a parameter server on `localhost:8000`, two workers on ports `localhost:8001` and `localhost:8002`, and a chief process. It is important to launch all of the 4 processes in the order below:

**Parameter Server**
```
python comet-tensorflow-distributed-paramter-server-strategy.py --worker_hosts localhost:8001,localhost:8002 --ps_hosts localhost:8000 --run_id 0 --task_type ps --task_index 0
```

Start the workers in different terminals 

**Worker 0**
```
python comet-tensorflow-distributed-parameter-server-strategy.py --worker_hosts localhost:8001,localhost:8002 --ps_hosts localhost:8000 --run_id 0 --task_type worker --task_index 0
```

**Worker 1**
```
python comet-tensorflow-distributed-parameter-server-strategy.py --worker_hosts localhost:8001,localhost:8002 --ps_hosts localhost:8000 --run_id 0 --task_type worker --task_index 1
```

**Chief process**

Finally, in a new terminal, start the chief process by running
```
python comet-tensorflow-distributed-parameter-server-strategy.py --worker_hosts localhost:8001,localhost:8002 --ps_hosts localhost:8000 --run_id 0 --task_type chief --task_index 0
```
The chief process will launch the [coordinator](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/parameter_server_training), that will distributed the data across workers, and synchronize the model weights in the parameter server.
