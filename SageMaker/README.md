## SageMaker Integration with Comet.ml

Comet's SageMaker integration is available to Enterprise customers only. If you are interested in learning more about Comet Enterprise, or are in a trial period with Comet.ml and would like to evaluate the SageMaker integration, please email support@comet.ml and credentials can be shared to download the correct packages.

## Examples Repository

This repository contains examples of using Comet.ml with SageMaker built-in Algorithms Linear Learner and Random Cut Forests. 


## Documentation

Full [documentation](http://www.comet.ml/docs/) and additional training examples are available on our website. 


## Installation

Please contact us for installation instructions.

## Configuration

The SageMaker integration is following the [Comet.ml Python SDK configuration](http://docs.comet.ml/python-sdk/advanced/#python-configuration) for configuring your Rest API Key, your workspace and project_name for created experiments. It's also following the [Boto configuration](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html) to find your SageMaker training jobs.

## Logging SageMaker training runs to Comet

Below find three different ways you can log your SageMaker jobs to Comet: with an existing regressor/estimator object, with a SageMaker Job Name, or with the last SageMaker job. 

***

### comet_ml_sagemaker.log_sagemaker_job

`log_sagemaker_job(sagemaker_object, api_key, workspace, project_name)`

Logs a Sagemaker job based on an estimator/regressor object 

* **estimator/regressor** = Sagemaker estimator/regressor object
* **api_key** = your Comet REST API key
* **workspace** = your Comet workspace
* **project_name** = your Comet project_name

***

### comet_ml_sagemaker.log_sagemaker_job_by_name

`log_sagemaker_job_by_name(job_name, api_key, workspace, project_name)`

Logs a specific Sagemaker training job based on the jobname from the Sagemaker SDK.

* **job_name** = Cloudwatch/Sagemaker training job name
* **api_key** = your Comet REST API key
* **workspace** = your Comet workspace
* **project_name** = your Comet project_name

***

### comet_ml_sagemaker.log_last_sagemaker_job

`log_last_sagemaker_job(api_key, workspace, project_name)`

Will log the last *started* Sagemaker training job based on the current config.

* **api_key** = your Comet REST API key
* **workspace** = your Comet workspace
* **project_name** = your Comet project_name
